# Privacy Policy for Prisma Chrome Extension

Last Updated: January 16, 2025

## Overview
Prisma is a Chrome extension that enhances your new tab page with Minecraft-themed wallpapers and customizable shortcuts. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.

## Data Collection and Use
### What We Collect
- **Local Storage Data**: Your customized shortcuts (website URLs, names, and icons) are stored locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API.
- **Technical Information**: Basic technical information necessary for the extension to function, such as your browser's online/offline status.

### What We Don't Collect
We do not collect or store:
- Personal information
- Browsing history
- Authentication data
- Location data
- Any other personal or sensitive information

### GitHub API Usage
Our extension interacts with the GitHub API solely to:
- Fetch a list of available wallpaper images
- Download selected wallpaper images for display
No user data is sent to GitHub during these operations.

## Data Storage
All user data (shortcuts and preferences) is stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage API. This data never leaves your browser and is not transmitted to any external servers.

## Third-Party Services
The only third-party service we use is the GitHub API, which is used exclusively for fetching wallpaper images. We do not share any user data with GitHub or any other third parties.

## Data Security
Since all data is stored locally on your device, security is handled by your browser's built-in security mechanisms. We do not transmit or store any user data on external servers.

## Your Rights
You have the right to:
- View your stored data (accessible through Chrome's developer tools)
- Delete your data (by removing the extension)
- Control your data (by managing shortcuts within the extension)

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.

## Contact
If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy or our data practices, please create an issue on our GitHub repository: [GitHub Repository Link]

## Compliance
This extension complies with the Chrome Web Store Developer Program Policies and does not:
- Sell or transfer user data to third parties
- Use data for purposes unrelated to the extension's functionality
- Use data for creditworthiness or lending purposes
